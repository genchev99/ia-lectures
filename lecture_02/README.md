## Exercises

#### Problem 01

Given an integer `n` from the standard input perform the following conditional operations:

- if the number is `odd` print on the standard output: `The number is odd`
- otherwise, print: `The number is even`

###### Input format

> A single line containing positive integer (n)

###### Simple input

> 2

###### Simple output

> The number is even


---

#### Problem 02

Given two integers `x` and `y` from the standard input perform the following conditional operations:

- if `x` is greater than `y` print: `X is greater than Y`
- if `x` is less than `y` print: `X is less than Y`
- if `x` is equal to `y` print: `X is equal to Y`

###### Input format

> Two lines containing two positive integers (x and y)

###### Simple input

> 16
>
> 32

###### Simple output

> X is less than Y

#### Problem 03

We'll call a number (integer) `weird` if:

- the number is `even`
- the number is in the inclusive range of `16` to `32`
- the number is in the inclusive range of `64` to `128`

Given an integer `n` from the standard input print `Weird` if it's (`n`) weird. Otherwise, print `Not Weird`.

###### Input format

> A single line containing positive integer (n)

###### Simple input

> 17

###### Simple output

> Weird

#### Problem 04

Given a floating point number `d` from the standard input perform the following conditional operations:

- if the number is greater or equal than `5.50` and less or equal than `6.00` print: `Отличен`
- if the number is greater or equal than `4.50` and less than `5.50` print: `Мн. Добър`
- if the number is greater or equal than `3.50` and less than `4.50` print: `Добър`
- if the number is greater or equal than `3.00` and less than `3.50` print: `Среден`
- if the number is greater or equal than `2.00` and less than `3.00` print: `Слаб`
- otherwise, print: `Error - the provided number is invalid`

###### Input format

> A single line containing decimal number (d)

###### Simple input

> 5.47

###### Simple output

> Мн. Добър

#### Problem 05

Given two integers `x` and `y` from the standard input perform the following arithmetic operations:

- Print the sum of `x` and `y`
- Print the difference of `x` and `y`
- Print the product of `x` and `y`
- Print if `x` is dividable by `y`
- Print if `y` is dividable by `x`
- Print the square of `x`
- Print `x` to the power of `y`

###### Input format

> Two lines containing two integers (x and y)

###### Simple input

> 9
>
> 3

###### Simple output

> 12
>
> 6
>
> 27
>
> True
>
> False
