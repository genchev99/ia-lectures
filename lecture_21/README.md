```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

## Problem 01

The Fibonacci numbers `0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...` are generated by the following simple rule

> F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
>
> F(1) = 1
>
> F(0) = 0

1. Create a function `iterative_fib(n: int)` which takes non-negative integer N and calculates the Nth Fibonacci number
   using iterative algorithm (don't use recursion).
2. Create a function `recursive_fib(n: int)` which takes non-negative integer N and calculates the Nth Fibonacci number
   using `recursive` algorithm
3. Create a linked list and add a method `fill_fib(n: int)` which will add the first N Fibonacci numbers to the list.
   Which approach will you use iterative or recursive?

## Problem 02

Extend the functionality of our LinkedList with the following method:

- `count(x)` - returns the number of elements in the list that are equal to `x`

## Problem 03

Extend the functionality of our LinkedList by creating a constructor that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and fills the
list with all elements between `x` and `y` (x, x+1, x+2... y)

## Problem 04

Extend the functionality of our LinkedList with the following method:

- `remove_all(x)` - removes all elements equal ot `x`

## Problem 05

Extend the functionality of our LinkedList with the following method:

- `map(f: function)` - takes a `function` as an argument and applies it to each member of the list.

## Problem 06

Implement a doubly linked list. Use this implementation for Node

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
```
