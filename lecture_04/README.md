### Problem 01

Who would‚Äôve guessed? Doomsday devices take a LOT of power. Commander Lambda wants to supplement the LAMBCHOP‚Äôs quantum
antimatter reactor core with solar arrays, and you‚Äôve been tasked with setting up the solar panels.

Due to the nature of the space station‚Äôs outer paneling, all of its solar panels must be squares. Fortunately, you have
one very large and flat area of solar material, a pair of industrial-strength scissors, and enough MegaCorp Solar Tape(
TM) to piece together any excess panel material into more squares. For example, if you had a total area of 12 square
yards of solar material, you would be able to make one 3x3 square panel (with a total area of 9). That would leave 3
square yards, so you can turn those into three 1x1 square solar panels.

Write a function solution(area) that takes as its input a single unit of measure representing the total area of solar
panels you have (between 1 and 1000000 inclusive) and returns a list of the areas of the largest squares you could make
out of those panels, starting with the largest squares first. So, following the example above, solution(12) would
return [9, 1, 1, 1].

```
Input:
solution.solution(15324)
Output:
15129,169,25,1

Input:
solution.solution(12)
Output:
9,1,1,1
```

### Problem 02

You need to pass a message to the bunny workers, but to avoid detection, the code you agreed to use is... obscure, to
say the least. The bunnies are given food on standard-issue plates that are stamped with the numbers 0-9 for easier
sorting, and you need to combine sets of plates to create the numbers in the code. The signal that a number is part of
the code is that it is divisible by 3. You can do smaller numbers like 15 and 45 easily, but bigger numbers like 144 and
414 are a little trickier. Write a program to help yourself quickly create large numbers for use in the code, given a
limited number of plates to work with.

You have L, a list containing some digits (0 to 9). Write a function solution(L) which finds the largest number that can
be made from some or all of these digits and is divisible by 3. If it is not possible to make such a number, return 0 as
the solution. L will contain anywhere from 1 to 9 digits. The same digit may appear multiple times in the list, but each
element in the list may only be used once.

```
Input:
solution.solution([3, 1, 4, 1])
Output:
    4311
Input:
solution.solution([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9])
Output:
    94311
```
